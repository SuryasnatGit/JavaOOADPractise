Design an OO parking lot. What classes and functions it should have. 
It should say full, empty and also should have spot for valet parking.
The lot has 3 different types of parking - regular, handicapped, compact


1. Use cases for this problem.
	- Parking can be single-level or multilevel.
	- Types of vehicles that can be parked, separate spaces for each type of vehicle.
	- Entry and exit points.

2. Constraints
	- Number of vehicles that can be accommodated of any type.

3. Basic Design/High-Level Components
	- Vehicle/Type of vehicle.
	- Entry and Exit points.
	- Different spots for vehicles.

4. Bottlenecks
	- Capacity breach for any type of vehicle.

5. Scalability
	- Scalable from single-level to multi-level
	- Scalable from Bike only parking to accommodate all kinds of vehicles.

Keeping these in minds, APIs can be designed in the language of your preference.
