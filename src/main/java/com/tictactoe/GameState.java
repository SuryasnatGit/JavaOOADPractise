/**
 * The GameState class contains all the information about the current state of a Tic Tac Toe game.
 * The squares array contains a character value for each square in the Tic Tac Toe board. An empty
 * square is represented by a space character. The player array contains the Players, who each have
 * their own specified symbol which is used to fill the squares array. The playerTurn integer is an
 * index which corresponds to the player in the player array whose turn it is. The constructor
 * creates an empty Tic Tac Toe board, both Players, and initializes the playerTurn index to zero.
 * The reseatBoard method returns the board to an empty state and resets the playerTurn to zero.
